## 🧠 What is LinkedOut?

**LinkedOut** is a mobile app that simulates job interviews and gives AI-powered feedback on your answers.

You:
- Choose a role (ex: Backend Dev, UX Designer, Emotional Wreck)
- Select difficulty (easy, medium, “I regret this”)
- Answer questions like a real interview
- Get roasted—gently—by an AI that scores and reviews your performance

## 💀 Why We Made This

- Because school said we had to.  
- Because interviews are terrifying.  
- Because therapy is expensive.  

So we made an app instead.

> Simulate interviews. Face your fear.
